# Financial Records Analysis

This JavaScript code is designed to analyse the financial records of a company, providing key insights into the dataset. The code performs the following calculations:

1. **Total Months:** Calculates the total months included in the dataset.
2. **Net Total Amount:** Computes the net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
3. **Average Change:** Determines the average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
4. **Greatest Increase:** Identifies the month with the greatest increase in profits, along with the corresponding amount.
5. **Greatest Decrease:** Identifies the month with the greatest decrease in losses and the corresponding amount.

## Usage

To use this code, include the financial records dataset in the `finances` array at the beginning of the script. The script will then output the analysis results to the console.

## Results
